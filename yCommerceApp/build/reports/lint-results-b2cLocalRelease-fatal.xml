        severity="Fatal"
        message="Fragments should be static such that they can be re-instantiated by the system, and anonymous classes are not static"

        summary="Fragment not instantiatable"
        explanation="From the Fragment documentation:&#xA;*Every* fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated when restoring its activity&apos;s state. It is strongly recommended that subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated; instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with `setArguments(Bundle)` and later retrieved by the Fragment with `getArguments()`."
